## Models

There are four models: locations, ingredients, toppings, pizzas. Each pizza has one location and many toppings. Each topping has one ingredient, and an amount of that ingredient on the left side or the right side.

## Building an order

The user is able to add toppings and specify on which half, and how much. The app will also tally the total calores and price based on the toppings.

## Stretch Goals

The image will display colored shapes representing ingredients as the ingredients are selected
