# Pizza Builder

This app will allow a user to build and order a pizza from a local restaurant chain.

## Models

There will be three models: locations, ingredients, orders. Each order will have one location and many ingredients.

## Building an order

The user will be able to add ingredients and specify on which half, and how much. The app will also tally the total calores and price based on the ingredients.

## Stretch Goals

The image will display colored shapes representing ingredients as the ingredients are selected
